# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## âœ… Compulsory Tasks Completed
- Created an **AWS Free-Tier account**  
- Set up **Billing Alarm** (via AWS CLI) with a threshold of **$0.01**  
- Configured **AWS Budget** at **$0.01**  
- Applied **IAM best practices**:
  - Enabled MFA on the root account  
  - Followed least privilege principle  
  - Created an IAM admin user to avoid using the root account  
- Created an **Architecture Diagram** using **Lucidchart**  
  - Exported diagram as **PDF** (saved in repo under `/journal/assets/`)  

## ðŸ“š Homework Challenges  
- âœ… Set up AWS CLI and tested billing alarms/budgets through CLI    

## ðŸ’¡ Reflection
- **Hardest part**: Creating the architecture diagram from scratch.  
- **New concept learned**: You can safely use an IAM Admin user instead of the root account.  
- **Improvement for next week**: Put my own spin on diagrams instead of just copying examples.
